# pacman-mirrorlist-update-git

Updates the pacman mirrorlist using only bash generated from the official
[Arch Mirror List][1] (US).

In reality, there is no real reason for this package other than that I am
trying to brush up on my shell scripting and package publishing skills since
I had been out of the game for a little bit, but maybe it could be of use to
someone when the official [pacman-mirrorlist package][2] is not working for
some reason or another.
